      There will be a sub-directory per Snapshot and the files in that Snapshot will be individually compressed.
   b. Database Storage / Blockstore - Snapshots are stored in a MongoDB database in a compressed, de-duplicated format. 
      Depending on data usage patterns the de-duplication can provide significant storage savings without the need for any specialized hardware or other software.  
   c. S3 Blockstore - Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 in a compressed, de-duplicated format. 
      Meanwhile, the metadata for each file within the Snapshots are kept in a local MongoDB database.
